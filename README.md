# MediTrust Health Hub

# PROJECT: MEDITRUST LIFE SCIENCE PVT LTD — DIGITAL HEALTHCARE & E-PHARMACY PLATFORM

## 1. Project Overview

Build a complete, responsive, dynamic healthcare e-commerce and digital health portfolio website for **MEDITRUST LIFE SCIENCE PVT LTD**, inspired by the functionality, navigation structure, and customer experience of https://www.1mg.com/.

The website must feel like a professional Indian healthcare platform offering online pharmacy shopping, OTC healthcare products, wellness products, diagnostic laboratory booking, online doctor consultation interfaces, health information, and customer account features.

This is not a simple static company portfolio. Build a multi-page digital healthcare platform with customer-facing pages, shopping interactions, reusable components, mock product data, and a comprehensive admin dashboard.

Use the reference website for functional inspiration. Create an original MEDITRUST visual identity and original layouts.

## 2. STRICT TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS

- React
- Vite

- Native JavaScript
- React hooks and built-in browser functionality

Do not use any additional libraries or frameworks.

Strictly prohibited:

- Next.js
- TypeScript

Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Use mock JavaScript objects and arrays as the complete data source.

Use localStorage only for optional client-side demo persistence, such as cart items, wishlist items, and mock admin settings. Do not use it as a database or represent it as a secure backend.

## 9. MOCK DATA

Create centralized mock data files.

Suggested structure:

`src/data/products.js`
`src/data/categories.js`
`src/data/labTests.js`
`src/data/doctors.js`
`src/data/articles.js`
`src/data/banners.js`

Use generic sample products and appropriately labeled mock prices. Mark medical products requiring prescriptions. Do not make therapeutic claims or recommend medicines for specific conditions.

Each product should have a stable mock ID, name, category, brand, pack size, price, MRP, image, description, and prescription requirement.

Use working image URLs from reliable image sources or locally supplied assets. Add fallbacks for broken images. Do not let missing images break the layout.

- Demo credentials displayed clearly on the login screen.

This is a frontend demonstration only. Do not represent it as secure authentication. Protect admin routes with a client-side session flag, but explicitly document that frontend-only authentication can be bypassed and is unsuitable for production.

- Mock revenue indicator.

### Persistence

All admin CRUD changes should update the React state immediately and persist in localStorage for the current browser demo where appropriate.

Add a "Reset Demo Data" action with a confirmation dialog.

Make it clear that data is local to the browser and will not synchronize across users or devices.

## 11. ADMIN DESIGN

Create a separate dashboard shell.

Desktop:

`src/context/AdminContext.jsx`

`src/data/`

`src/pages/`

`src/pages/admin/`

`src/utils/`

Use reusable components rather than duplicating markup across pages.
